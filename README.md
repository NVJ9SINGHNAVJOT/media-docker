# Media-Docker - Version 4 (Beta)

**Version 4 (Beta)** introduces a refined microservices architecture, specifically tailored to handle each type of media file (video, audio, image) through dedicated services. Each consumer service now operates with a dedicated worker pool for a single media type, significantly improving load balancing and optimizing resource utilization.

**Media-Docker** is a comprehensive media management platform designed for processing, converting, storing, and streaming media using FFmpeg. This release includes new system components such as a frontend client, backend server, Kafka-based message queuing system, and worker-based consumers for media processing tasks. Additionally, a fault-tolerant failed consumer service has been implemented to manage retries for failed jobs, increasing overall system reliability.

## Note

- This project is created for developers, eliminating the hassle of using third-party services to store critical media files.
- It **_can be deployed on a live server_** as **_all features_** all fully **_operational_**.
- **When running single or multiple instances of consumer services, the total number of workers per service must not exceed the number of Kafka topic partitions.**

## Acknowledgements

This project uses several open-source libraries, each of which is credited to its respective authors and owners. We would like to extend a big thank you to all the contributors and maintainers of these libraries for their hard work and dedication.

A complete list of the libraries used can be found in the go.mod and go.sum files.

## Project Structure

- **media-docker-client**: Serves static media assets and processes frontend requests for video streaming, image, and audio retrieval.

- **media-docker-server**: The backend service that handles media upload requests, validating them and sending messages to Kafka for processing.

- **media-docker-kafka-cluster**: Manages the flow of messages from the media-docker-server to the media-docker-consumer by distributing them across Kafka topics to aid in media processing tasks. It also enables the mediaDocker module (as a consumer) to consume response messages for media files once conversion is complete.

- **media-docker-kafka-consumer**: Consumes messages from Kafka topics and performs media-related operations, such as creating video segments or converting audio bitrates with **FFmpeg**. This component handles resource-intensive tasks.

- **media-docker-failed-consumer**: Consumes messages from the **_failed-letter-queue_** (which acts as the dead-letter queue in this project) and processes them with retries based on the original topic. This minimizes the chances of sending a failed response, thereby enhancing fault tolerance.

- **mediaDocker module (in the \_examples folder for backend servers, according to language)**: Contains the core logic for uploading files to the Media-Docker service and manages the consumption of messages from the Kafka response topic for media file task results.

## Features

### Video Streaming

- **Media-Docker** utilizes **FFmpeg** to convert uploaded video files into various resolutions (360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p), making them available for on-demand streaming.
- Videos are segmented for seamless playback and adaptive quality streaming, allowing users to switch between different qualities dynamically.

### Audio Processing

- Audio files are stored with the required **bitrate**, as specified by the backend, ensuring flexibility and support for various audio quality needs.
- Dedicated **consumer workers** manage audio processing tasks, ensuring efficient and scalable handling of large media libraries.

### Image Compression

- Images are compressed and stored according to custom **compression settings** provided by the backend service.
- Processing and compression of images are managed by consumer workers, optimizing efficiency and storage.

## Kafka Integration

The media-docker-kafka-cluster component leverages a Kafka cluster with 3 brokers in KRaft mode to receive messages from different topics, promoting scalable and asynchronous media processing. The **media-docker-kafka-consumer** executes the primary tasks associated with each topic. Key topics and their respective responsibilities include:

- **video**: Manages video conversion and segmentation tasks.
- **video-resolutions**: Handles resolution conversion for videos.
- **audio**: Processes and stores audio files based on the specified bitrate.
- **image**: Manages image compression and storage.
- **delete-file**: Oversees requests for media file deletion.
- **media-docker-files-response**: Holds the results of media file conversions for the mediaDocker module to consume.
- **failed-letter-queue**: Facilitates the retry mechanism for media files that have encountered issues.

By leveraging **Kafka** and **FFmpeg**, the project guarantees scalable, efficient media processing with dedicated workers for each topic.

## FFmpeg Integration

- **FFmpeg** serves as the primary tool for converting video and audio files, segmenting videos into streamable parts, adjusting resolutions, and compressing images for storage.

## Conclusion

The **Media-Docker** project, now in version 2, is a complete media processing solution built for scalability and efficiency using **Kafka** workers, **FFmpeg**, and a robust client-server architecture. It supports advanced video streaming, flexible audio processing, and image compression tailored to specific needs, making it an ideal solution for media-heavy applications.

## Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/NVJ9SINGHNAVJOT/media-docker.git
  ```
- Set up environment variables.
  In the root directory, you will find the **.env.example** file. Replace it with the following files:
  - **.env.client**
  - **.env.server**
  - **.env.consumer**
  - **.env.failed**
  
  _**.env.example** file contains example values for all the environment variables._
  
  Ensure that you set the required variables for each application.
- When configuring the workers value in **.env.consumer** and **.env.failed**, ensure that the total number of workers does not exceed the number of partitions for each topic. Exceeding the partition count will result in idle workers. Additionally, if you're running multiple instances of Docker container services, the combined total number of workers for a given topic across all instances should also not exceed the partition count for that topic.

- Project can be run on local machine by Docker or by installing dependencies locally.
- **Using Docker:** **_Recommended for Production_**

  ```sh
  cd media-docker
  task compose-up
  ```

- **Using local machine dependencies:** **_Recommended for Development_**

1. Install [golang](https://go.dev) (if not already installed).
2. Install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) (if not already installed).
3. If you have Apache Kafka installed locally, skip the _task dev-kafka_ and _task dev-kafka-topics_ steps, and create the topics as described in the _this_create_kafka_topics.sh_ file. Otherwise, start Docker (Apache Kafka is used in this project with Docker) and execute the following task commands:

   ```sh
   cd media-docker
   task i
   task dev-kafka
   task dev-kafka-topics

   # Below tasks need to run in different terminals:
   task consumer
   task failed
   task server
   task client
   ```

- Client will start running at (eg: 7000) 7000 port. [`http://localhost:7000`](http://localhost:7000).
- Server will start running at (eg: 7007) 7007 port. [`http://localhost:7007`](http://localhost:7007).

- You can execute the **_task_** command in the terminal to view all the available commands in the task file.

---
## Usage

After setting up all components, upload media files through the server, which processes the uploads and sends messages to Kafka for various media tasks. Consumers will handle the intensive operations, while the client serves the processed files.

### Network

- Docker Network Connection: When running your backend server inside Docker, use the media-docker-proxy network to connect it to the media-docker service. This ensures secure and internal communication between services.

- Backend Service Configuration: In your backend service's Docker configuration, make sure to add the media-docker-proxy network under the networks section. This network is dedicated specifically to the media-docker service, facilitating communication between your backend and the media-docker services within Docker.

- Local Development: If your backend service is running locally (outside of Docker), you can also run the media-docker services locally. In this case, use localhost in your media docker module configuration to connect to the services.

### Configuration Parameters

Set the following configuration parameters in the media docker module:

- mediaDockerServerBaseURL:
```ts
"http://localhost:7007" | "http://media-docker-server:7007"
```
The base URL for the media server API. Use localhost for development and media-docker-server for Docker or production environments.

- kafkaBrokers:
```ts
"localhost:9092" | "media-docker-kafka-0:9092,media-docker-kafka-1:9092,media-docker-kafka-2:9092"
```
Comma-separated list of Kafka broker addresses. Use localhost for development and Docker container addresses for Docker or production environments.

## Examples

### Node.js Integration

- Copy the mediaDocker.ts file from the examples folder into your project.
- Example: Place the file in the utils folder of your project.

- First connect to media-docker-server

```ts
import mediaDocker from "@/utils/mediaDocker";

// First, connect to the media-docker-server
async function connectToMediaDocker() {
  try {
    // Establish a connection to both the Media-Docker server and the Kafka broker.
    // The connect function requires four parameters:
    // 1. mediaDockerServerKey: A string representing the API key for the media server (e.g., "your_server_key").
    // 2. mediaDockerServerBaseURL: The URL for the Media-Docker server.
    //    Use "http://localhost:7007" for development or "http://media-docker-server:7007" when using Docker.
    // 3. kafkaBrokers: The broker addresses for the Kafka cluster.
    //    Use "localhost:9092" for local development or "media-docker-kafka-0:9092,media-docker-kafka-1:9092,media-docker-kafka-2:9092" for Docker.
    // 4. messageHandler: A function to process incoming Kafka messages.
    //    This handler operates asynchronously in the background for each message received from the Kafka topic.

    await mediaDocker.connectMediaDockerAndKafka(
      "YOUR_SERVER_API_KEY",
      "http://localhost:7007", // Use "http://media-docker-server:7007" when in Docker
      "localhost:9092", // Use "media-docker-kafka-0:9092,media-docker-kafka-1:9092,media-docker-kafka-2:9092" when in Docker
      async (message) => {
        // Handle incoming messages from Kafka
        console.log("Received message:", message);
        // Received message example:
        // {
        //     id: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        //     fileType: "video",
        //     status: "completed"
        // }

        // Implement your logic based on message processing status
        if (message.status === "completed") {
          console.log(`Processing completed for file ID: ${message.id}`);
          // Processing completed for file ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
        } else {
          console.error(`Processing failed for file ID: ${message.id}`);
