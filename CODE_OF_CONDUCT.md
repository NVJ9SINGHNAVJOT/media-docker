## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and respect toward others.
- Being open to different viewpoints and providing constructive feedback.

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Using sexualized language or imagery.
- Engaging in personal attacks, trolling, or harassment.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
As the current project maintainer, I will enforce this Code of Conduct as needed. In the future, should others join the project, the same standards will apply.
